This flowchart illustrates the process of PQ integration into the main grid, focusing on the operation of a substation that serves only heavy industrial users and acts as the source of the distribution network. Initially, the high voltage power is protected by a lightning arrester, followed by a high voltage circuit breaker to ensure circuit safety. Subsequently, the power passes through an isolating switch for further isolation and maintenance convenience. The power then goes through a reactor for inductance adjustment and is converted by a transformer from high voltage to low voltage suitable for distribution. Finally, the low voltage power is compensated for reactive power by a capacitor, ensuring the stability and efficiency of distribution
