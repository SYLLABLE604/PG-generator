This flowchart describes the process of integrating PV (or thermal power) into the main grid. Initially, the generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy, and a step-up transformer increases the voltage to meet the requirements of long-distance transmission. To enhance economic efficiency and transmission effectiveness, the AC power is converted to DC power via a rectifier and transmitted over long distances through a DC transmission line. During transmission, reactive power compensators such as synchronous condensers or STATCOMs are used to compensate for reactive power, ensuring the stability and efficiency of power transmission. Finally, circuit breakers and switches control the flow of electricity, ensuring the safety and stability of the circuit.
