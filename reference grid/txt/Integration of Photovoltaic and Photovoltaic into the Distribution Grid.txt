This flowchart describes the process of integrating PV (photovoltaic) and wind power into the main grid. Initially, the wind or hydropower generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy, with a portion of the electricity stored in batteries. The remaining electricity is passed through a step-up transformer to increase the voltage, meeting the requirements of long-distance transmission. To enhance economic efficiency and transmission effectiveness, the AC power is converted to DC power via a rectifier and transmitted over long distances through a DC transmission line. During transmission, reactive power compensators such as synchronous condensers or STATCOMs are used to compensate for reactive power, ensuring the stability and efficiency of power transmission.
